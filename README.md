# CIS-400-final-project

## Abstract
The importance of tools that help in understanding the predictions and decisions a machine 
learning model makes is growing. There is a need to be able to understand the outcomes of a 
model and the ethical implications of it. In this paper, I analyze the quality and effectiveness of 
visual explanation tools provided by Yellowbrick and present a framework that can help analyze
and address the ethical implications of a model. The results show that Yellowbrick did provide 
quality explanations that aided in understanding the models used. The explanations aligned with 
what social science says about the relationship between sex/gender and mathematics grades.
Furthermore, I found that the ethical framework aided in analyzing ethics regarding the grade 
predicting model.

The research paper can be read by viewing in the document 'CIS 400 Ethical Analysis of Predicting Grades with Machine Learning'.
